-------------------

This package contains miscellaneous functions used at the Department
of Statistics at TU Wien (E1071) for which we don't know a better
place (i.e., a special package) where to put them.


For the PGM image input/output stuff you need libpgm and libpbm. If
these are not available on your system, please edit the Makefile in
the src subdirectory and remove the strings pgm.c, -lpgm and -lpbm.
