Changes in Version 1.3.14:

  o Several Docu bug fixes (plot.bclust, impute, stft, svm.formula, svm.default)

  o upgrade to libsvm 2.5. New feature: predict.svm() optionally
    returns decision values for multi-class classification

  o svm-vignette gave warnings due to rank deficiency in Ozone data

  o naiveBayes() now also supports metric predictors, and the standard interface.

Changes in Version 1.3.13:

  o Bug fixes in svm:
    - Prediction of 1 single observation gave an error
    - Only k instead of k*(k-1)/2 rho coefficients have been returned by svm 
      (k number of classes), having caused nonsensical results for k > 3.
  o The `svmdoc' file in inst/doc now is a vignette.

Changes in Version 1.3-12:

  o The x argument of cmeans() and bclust() is now automatically coerced
    to a matrix.

  o Started tests directory

  o New method: `naiveBayes' classifier for categorical predictors

  o optimization of `read.matrix.csr' which used to be rather slow

  o Bug fixes for the `svm' interface: when the data included
    categorical predictors, the scaling procedure did not only
    affect the metric variables, but also the binary variables
    in the model matrix.

  o Function `scaclust removed'. Bug has to be fixed. 

Changes in Version 1.3-10:

  o Now supports libsvm 2.4

  
Changes in Version 1.3-9:

  o rdiscrete() is now simply a wrapper for sample() and provided for backwards     compatibility only. 

  o Minor bug fixes in `svm' and `tune' (mostly interface issues). New
    plot function for objects of class `svm' working for the 2d-classification 
    case.

    
Changes in Version 1.3-7:

  o svm() now supports the `matrix.csr' format, as handled by the
   `SparseM' package. Predictors and response variable (if numeric) are scaled per
    default.
  o A new `plot' function for `svm' objects visualizes classification
    models by plotting data and support vectors in the data input
    space, along with the class borders.
  o A new generic `tune' function allows parameter tuning of arbitrary
    functions using, e.g., boot strapping, or cross validation.
    Several convenience wrappers (e.g., for svm, nnet, and rpart) do exist.

	
Changes in Version 1.3-3:

  o Bug fixes in various bclust routines: stop() if required packages
    are not found
  o svm() now interfaces LIBSVM 2.35 which is a bug fix release.
    A call with invalid parameters now no longer causes R to be
    terminated, and the C(++) code became completely silent.
  o Bugs fixed in fclustIndex function and print.fclust.  

    
Changes in Version 1.3-1:

  o Functions rmvnorm and dmvnorm for multivariate normal
    distributions have been moved to package mvtnorm.

  o Bug fixes in print.fclust and fclustIndex.

  o fixed floyd.c (ANSI C pedantic warnings)

  
Changes in Version 1.2-1:

  o Bug fixes in cmeans.c, cshell.c and scaclust.c (R header files
    included and unused variables removed)
  
  o Bug fixes in Rsvm.c and svm.R (incomplete list of returned Support 
    Vectors).

  o Encapsulate kmeans call in bclust() in a try construct, because
    kmeans gives an error when a cluster becomes empty (which can
    happen for almost every data set from time to time).

    
Changes in Version 1.2-0:

  o Added functions for bagged clustering, see help(bclust).

  o read.pnm() and write.pgm() have been removed from e1071, much
    improved versions can now be found in the new package pixmap. 

  o Lots of documentation updates and bugfixes.

  o Support Vector Machine interface now upgraded to libsvm V. 2.31
    featuring:
    - Multi-Class Classification
    - weighting of classes for C-classification (for asymmetric sample sizes)
    - nu-regression
    - Formula Interface
    - k-fold cross-validation
    In addition, an introductory article is provided in directory
    `docs/' (svmdoc.pdf).

  o classAgreement now features an option to match factor levels

  o updated API design for the fuzzy clustering functions
    (cmeans, cshell, scaclust). Documentation updates and function
    name changes (cmeanscl -> cmeans, validity.measures -> fclustIndex)
